# Correlation-btw-Stock-and-News

Since US stock market is one of the biggest area in the world, various factors affect the US stock market such as foreign exchange rate, interest rate, influential people's speech, national news, world news, and other markets. Thus, we can have questions reasonably following these:
- How much does stock market relate to daily news? 
- Is it possible that people predict stock market based on daily news?
Of course, world news will not have the greatest impact on the US stock market. However, experiments show us there are slight effects between them. 

In conclusion, The diverse experiments are performed to answer the questions. The accuracy and area under curve have a range from 0.45 to 0.56. Those show us difference of each models, markets, and evaluation methods. According to the reference, I expected that the accuracy of experiments will be over 60% but it is not. I believe this is a result caused by various factors: size of data, machine learning technic, and weak relation between them. Nevertheless, the advanced model has slightly better result than the basic model. In conclusion, I would say carefully that US industrial and foreign exchange market do not have a strongly significant relation with world news.
